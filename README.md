# TempControl

The aim of this Lab is to implement a 'Bang-Bang' controller using Arduino. 

### The Setting
A small lamp will be used as a small heater for a small room. When the temperature reaches a 'LOW' point (too cold), the lamp should turn on. When the temperature reaches a 'HIGH' point (too hot), the lamp should be turned off.
